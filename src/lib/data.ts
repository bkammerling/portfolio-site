With the Praise, you can send thank yous, shoutouts and big praise to your teammates on the General Channel for everyone to see. Type Praise, add one or more teammates, and Praise tells the whole team about it, with an added gif on the theme of praising.
It's built serverless and uses Netlify functions for the oAuth and the shortcode functionality. It had to get through Slack's strict app guidelines to be shown on the marketplace.`,
